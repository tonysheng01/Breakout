# Breakout
This is a remake of the classic arcade game _Breakout_ created with the OpenGL graphics library. While exciting new features are added, the fundamentals of the original game are preserved.

## Features
- Fully customizable levels
- Randomly spawining powerups
- Cool post-processings and particle effects

## Tutorial
The general rules are no different from those of the original game developed by Atari. The setup consists of layers of bricks as well as obstacles that cannot be destroyed. A ball travels across the screen, destroying the bricks it touches and bouncing off obstacles. The player controls a horizontally moving paddle to prevent the ball from hitting the bottom of the screen, in which case they lose a life. The goal is to eliminate all bricks without losing all lives.

> ⬅️ ➡️    Use the **A** and **D** keys to move the paddle across the screen

> ⬆️          Press **SPACE** to release the ball when it is stuck
